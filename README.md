# Instructions 

Welcome to the Fitness App! 

In the main page, please enter your name and click on the start button, which will lead you to the main page of the app. 
There will be background music for this app, and you can use the mute button and the volume slider to adjust the volume of background music. 
If you do not like the dark background and the hardcore music in our default setting, you can click on the relax button, which will change the background of the application to a more relaxing background, and the background music will also be changed. 
Then you can also change the theme back to the hardcore theme by clicking on the button ìHardcoreî on the upper right side of the window. 

In the middle of the main page, you can see a human body picture. 
You can click on the muscles of the body, and information on the corresponding muscle and some exercise guides will be displayed at the left side of the window. 
To close the information section, please click on cancel button on the top right side of the muscle information block. 

If you want to do this exercise, you can click on the "add" button to add this task to the to-do list which is on the right side of the main page. 
This to-do list will keep track of the number of tasks currently inside of this list, and this number will be shown at the lower part of the to-do list. 
If you do not want a task in the to-do list anymore, you can click on this task and then click on the delete button at the bottom of the window. 

After finishing a task, you can click on the ìfinishî button at the lower part of the information block, and a "finished" label will be shown and cover this task, which can help you mark the task as finished and help with your schedule.

The body model in the middle part of the main page can be rotated. 
You can use the slider at the lower part of the main page to turn the body picture around and see the side and back of the muscle model. 
The side and back of the muscle are also clickable, and you can click on muscles on the body figure and check the information (and add to the to-do list, as mentioned above).

You can use the "quit" button at the upper left corner of the main page to quit the program.
